The Maker-Monday is our evening where we are open for everyone, without a dedicaded agenda. Here you can take a look at our house, the machines or just come to chill and have a chat with the people.

You already have an idea for your project? Awesome, we can help you to realize it. You don't have a glue yet? Just come and take a look at the projects that where already realized in our location. Or just exchange with other people in the house and develop creative ideas together.

Please take a look at our [calendar](/en/termine-und-oeffnungszeiten/) when we are open next time.
