The Jugend hackt Lab:Ulm opens its own space for you in July to experiment. Come with your ideas and present them in the Lab. Don't you have a concrete project and are looking for inspiration? Don't worry! Be inspired by others or ask for small challenges in the lab. As with the workshops, our great mentors will accompany you in the lab as well.
