You’re not a fan of fast fashion, but still want variety in your closet? Then come to our clothing swap during this year’s Fashion Revolution Week! This time, the student group for Sustainability organizes the clothing swap at Verschwörhaus Ulm together with Greenpeace Ulm/Neu-Ulm and the IJM student group. Bring your clothes and take new pieces home - it doesn't have to be a 1:1 swap. This way, you can get rid of your unworn clothes and find super cool ones. The clothes that are left at the end of our swap will be donated. 

 

Additional Information:

The current Corona regulations of the state of Baden-Württemberg apply (<https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/aktuelle-infos-zu-corona/aktuelle-corona-verordnung-des-landes-baden-wuerttemberg/>). Please check Verschwörhaus daily for the latest regulations.

 

Please bring only washed and intact items. For repairing clothes you are welcome to come to our sewing café. For more info, visit <https://www.uni-ulm.de/misc/hg-nachhaltigkeit/aktionen/naehcafe/>.
