At the end of 2025, another milestone was reached in our [house photography](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Drohnenfotografie_tempor%C3%A4rhaus_(2025)):

After announcing the thousandth image on Wikimedia Commons in August, the thousandth image from our in-house camera has now been published under a free license within a year, in addition to the end of 2025.

Among other things, this year, the demolition of the Gänstorbrücke and the cooling towers in Gundremmingen were documented. The “Lebendiger Kreuzweg” (Living Way of the Cross) in Ulm and Neu-Ulm was also captured on camera, as was the German Music Festival, which was hosted in Ulm in 2025. In addition to photos of a wide variety of other events and objects, the year was rounded off with the first royalty-free photos of the medieval Christmas market in Neu-Ulm.

And this month, players from the [2nd Basketball Bundesliga ProB](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProB) were once again photographed at the Orange Academy in order to gradually document the various teams in Wikimedia Commons.

Of course, we were also represented again this year at the [Chaos Community Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/) (39C3). At the Free Knowledge Hub, we informed people together with [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.de), [CodeForGermany](https://codefor.de/), and [FragDenStaat](https://fragdenstaat.de/) about free knowledge.
Visitors also had the opportunity to admire some of our extensive range of machinery and various projects from temporärhaus.

[Eli](https://mastodon.social/@kiselazelka) had worked hard in the run-up to the Congress, spending hours crafting a multi-layered stamp template that could be used to print different-colored postcard motifs. You can admire one of the results on [our Mastodon channel](https://chaos.social/@temporaerhaus/115797878782733585).

Free knowledge was also the topic of discussion here locally at an initial get-together with people from the Neu-Ulm City Archives. For example, there is an idea to jointly create a retrospective of Augsburger Straße 23-25 (our current home) and present the changes that have taken place over time. We have also been offered a guided tour of the city archives. We are excited to see what exciting projects will develop from this in the future.

The rest of the month was also quite busy at the house. Open Data Monday took place twice, and our TTN/LoRaWAN group and CTF/PPP group also met on two days each. In addition, during 39C3, a few people gathered at the house to watch livestreams of the talks together. The sewing café opened its doors once, and our cooperation with [ADFC Ulm](https://ulm.adfc.de/) continued with a “RAD-ikal technisch” event. Last but not least, the last MakerMonday of the year was a complete success, attracting 38 visitors and inspiring many people.

There was also good news at the end of the year: Our funding from [Wikimedia Germany](https://www.wikimedia.de/) has been extended until 2026. This means we can continue to contribute to free access to knowledge and tools as a [local space](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:F%C3%B6rderung/Lokale_Community-R%C3%A4ume). Many thanks to Wikimedia Germany!

We would also like to thank all the people in front of and behind the scenes at our organization who actively (through volunteer work) or passively (e.g., through [donations](/spenden)) support us. Without you, none of this would be possible!

_PS: We are still looking for a new property, to be ready by the end of 2026 at the latest. If you know someone who knows someone, ... you know ..., then [please let us know](/umzug) so that we can continue our great activities in the future!_
