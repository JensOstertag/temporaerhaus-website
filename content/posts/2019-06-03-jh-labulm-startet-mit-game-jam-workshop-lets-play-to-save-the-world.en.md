Climate change really sucks? Without previous knowledge you can turn your ideas for a better environment into videogames! With the Game Jam Workshop the regular Jugend hackt Lab offer starts in Ulm. In a Game Jam you invent and design videogames together in a short time. You will be accompanied by our Jugend hackt mentors. Your games can then be presented by you at the Night of Culture on 21 September in the VerschwÃ¶rhaus and played by Night-of-Culture-visitors.
