The Verschwörhaus also got off to a good start in 2023 :)
In addition to the upcoming court date and our search for a new location, there is great news: We have a new laser cutter! Many, many thanks to the donor Markus Stäuble. This generous donation replaces one of the tools that we unfortunately had to leave behind when we moved out of the Weinhof.
As soon as we have found a new home, we will make the laser cutter available for use by the general public, and we are already looking forward to the ideas and projects that you will implement with it.

We are always overwhelmed by your support and encouragement. Whether it's tips for new premises, small or large donations in kind or money, or just a few kind words that give us strength. Thank you!
We hope to see you all again soon - also so that you can try out and use the new laser cutter yourself :)
