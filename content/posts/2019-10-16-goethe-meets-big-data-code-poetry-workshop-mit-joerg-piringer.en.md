Performance artist and computer scientist Jörg Piringer will show you how you can use computers to create your own data poetry and perform it audio-visually. The workshop closes with a poetry slam and is free and open to all young people from 12 to 18 years. Jörg Piringer is coming to Ulm for the first time and will also give you an insight into his critical view on Big Data and closed source codes.

**Saturday, 16 November 2019; 12:00 - 4.00pm  in the Verschwörhaus**
