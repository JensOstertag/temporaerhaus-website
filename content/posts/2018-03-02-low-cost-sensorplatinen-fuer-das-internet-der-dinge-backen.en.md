Saturday, March 3d is Open Data Day, and [not only can you build your own air particulate sensors with us][1] – you can also prepare, solder and operate your very own, minster-shaped sensor node at Verschwörhaus.

In the end, you will have built your own transceiver for the Internet of Things for a mere 10 Euros. In and around Ulm you will be able to push your own sensor data into [The Things Network][2]: GPS coordinates of your bicycle, soil moisture at your garden, or the water temperature at your favourite secret bathing spot. No WiFi, no SIM card, no monthly fee required – just small packets over long range into your favourite, community-based network!

Please RSVP via E-Mail to johannes dot deger at uni-ulm.de – short-notice guests are welcome, but RSVPing will guarantee you a spot.

**Schedule**  
12:30: Placing components onto the PCB and soldering it in the oven
13:30: Hand-soldering the microcontroller board
14:00: Send your first packets via TTN!

Prior soldering experience is helpful, but not necessary. Special thanks to [initiative.ulm.digital][3], who supported our volunteer team during the design of the PCB!
