It's already mid-December and it's been winter outside a few times - and if you're wondering why we've posted so little, you'll find the answer below - spoiler: It has to do with your donations and an unexpected grant we're currently working on until the end of the year. Together, we'll get the new house in a better condition than you were used to in the old place by January \<\3

### That was November

In November, we once again had 14 public events, i.e. an event open to everyone almost every other day – including several events together with the [House of Sustainability,](https://www.h-d-n.org/) with whom we are working ever more closely.

As every month, the **sewing café** – organized together with the [University Group for Sustainability](https://www.uni-ulm.de/misc/hg-nachhaltigkeit/hsgn/) – attracted around 20 people who reworked, repaired and improved textiles on our growing inventory of sewing and overlock machines. 
There was also a joint meeting with HSGN and the House of Sustainability at the beginning of the month, which was attended by around 30 people.

The **Maker Mondays** with our open woodworking workshop, 3D printing and laser cutting lab also continue to be popular. Around 30 people attended each of the two events in November. 
And we are also delighted with the many project photos that people have sent us of the things we build when they are finished – for example the beautiful dog bowl holder in the photo above. 
The only thing that has been going on in our community longer than Maker Monday is the exchange evening for **The Things Network/LoRaWAN**, which also took place twice in November.

Even back at the old location, we had regular exchanges on IT security topics: **[Capture The Flag](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_Flag#Computersicherheit) (CTF)** is the name of these meetings and competitions, which had been part of the regular program at Weinhof and started up again in November with the old familiar crew, which makes us very happy! 
But there are also people coming forward with completely new programming: The **Hydra Live Coding Workshop** introduced the video synth coding language [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) to everybody interested. 
What makes us happy about with these and other programming is that we have a steadily growing base of regular visitors for our regular program. 
And on the other hand, there are always people coming up with exciting new topics, which are then attended by completely new faces. 
So it's definitely worth keeping an eye on our [calendar!](/termine-und-oeffnungszeiten/)

This is where you will now also find the [**OpenStreetMap-Stammtisch,**](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Ulm_Neu-Ulm/Stammtisch) as a regular event. Interested parties and contributors from the region have been meeting for many years to exchange ideas – and since November, this regular meeting takes place within our space, which makes us very happy. 
The **Live Let's Plays** on current and vintage gaming culture are also very popular almost every week – on four occasions in November.

In addition, as in every month, there were at least as many internal construction, organization and planning meetings to further develop the shared house and the offers. And not least because of a wonderful end-of-year surprise.

## November and December fever: We're expanding!

We've already mentioned it at the top: Something is happening here (again). 
Since summer, we've been unpacking all our inventory out of boxes and putting it back into operation. 
And at the latest since our reopening in September, it has gradually become clear what smaller and larger items we are missing in terms of equipment for smooth operations, because it is still stored somewhere in the Weinhof as city inventory that we don't have access to anymore.

We are very, very grateful that so many people from near and far have supported us over all this time through [supporting memberships](/verein/) or on [betterplace](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/85727-das-temporaerhaus-gestaltet-selbstbestimmte-stadtentwicklung-mit) with direct donations for replacements. Since November, we have been in the process of procuring all the missing equipment and machines that have been financed through your donations.

![Something has landed at the post office – but without a big cargo bike, it's not that easy to get it into the house!](/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/monatsbericht_logistik.jpg)

Totally unexpectedly, a funding opportunity arose from the [German Foundation for Engagement and Volunteering](https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/) (DSEE) at very short notice. The DSEE had already funded us so generously [at the end of 2021](/förderung-der-deutschen-stiftung-für-engagement-und-ehrenamt-dsee/) that we were able to significantly expand the equipment we had at the time and our associated skills to a truly fantastic level. At the time, however, this was still intended as a supplement to the existing basic equipment procured by the city over the previous five years. In several places, we had replaced the previous equipment with better devices after gaining experience and know-how about what a place like ours needs and what is practical for the public to use. For other parts, however, we were still assuming at the end of 2021 that we would be able to continue the model of a third location that is self-governed by committed volunteers in a city-funded space.

Thanks to DSEE funding, we can now _significantly_ accelerate the replacement of the equipment gaps, which will allow us to expand the quality of our offer and return to what people were used to from us. And last, but not least, we can also continue with some energy-related measures in order to be able to use the charming but somewhat outdated building with slightly less energy.

Of course, this takes up a lot of our free time - over the last few weeks, we've been getting our procurement plan up to scratch, putting together shopping baskets and obtaining comparative offers. And last but not least, the incoming orders had to be received, inventoried and sorted. If we have posted a little less in places or emails took a little longer for us to reply to: It could be because of that :D

![Choosing is one thing, ordering is another. But then stuff still has to be added to the inventory!](/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/monatsbericht_inventarisierung.jpg)

However, we would of course like to make our new items available to you as quickly as possible. That's why it's still worth dropping by. And if there's still enough time between ordering, unpacking and keeping track of invoices, we want to show you the best purchases here and on our social media channels :)
