The Verschwörhaus and the vh Ulm invite you: The Viennese code poet Jörg Piringer critically uses the immense digital data storage and transforms it performatively into "cyberpoetry": sometimes as techno poem another time as visual sound poetry. His work underlines the urgency of a critical-creative examination of big data and closed source codes. As a pioneer of a new digital avant-garde, he appears for the first time with his cyberpoetry in front of an audience in Ulm. Drinks and digital beats will follow.

Admission 8€ / reduced 6€. Afterparty afterwards (DJ Samuel Rettig/Gleis 44).
