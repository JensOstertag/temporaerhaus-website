Since 2013, people have been using 360° images on [GeoGuessr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGuessr) and similar games to guess where a randomly selected image was taken.
[Since 2017](https://github.com/blinry/wikidata-guessr/commit/d99166765e4c50f15440b0d5d9bb55ec96fd0db5), with [Wikidata-Guessr](http://guessr.morr.cc/) by [blinry](https://blinry.org/), there is also a guessing game where you can guess cities, parliament buildings, mountains, roller coasters, or [any other things](https://blinry.org/wikidata-guessr/).

For Kulturnacht 2025, we have [built our own version of blinry's Wikidata-Guessr with a special focus on Neu-Ulm](https://temporaerhaus.github.io/wikidata-guessr/).


Für die Kulturnacht 2025 haben wir [eine eigene Variante von blinrys Wikidata-Guessr mit einem speziellen Augenmerk auf Neu-Ulm gebaut.](https://temporaerhaus.github.io/wikidata-guessr/)
Currently, streets, Stolpersteine, houses, and „tourist attractions“ are available—although the latter are currently almost exclusively limited to federal fortress buildings in Wikidata.
If you like, you can of course expand this yourself in Wikidata—or guess where the currently available objects can be found :)

_Hint: Especially for streets or buildings, it is not the exact location of the photo that is important, but rather the geometric center of the object.
For a photo of a house, this is the building itself, for a street, it would be the center of the street._
